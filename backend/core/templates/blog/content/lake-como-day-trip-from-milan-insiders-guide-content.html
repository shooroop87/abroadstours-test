            <p class="mt-20">
                Before writing this article, we read the top 10 results on Google about what to do on Lake Como and how to plan a day trip from Milan. The information was very confusing, and it mainly consisted of the experiences of people who had spent one or two days at Lake Como, sharing their own impressions. To plan your day trip to Lake Como, you need information about logistics and which places you should visit. Additionally, you need to know about the places and activities that are a ‚Äúfight for survival.‚Äù
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-30 md:text-24">Three different types of tours to Lake Como from Milan that you may find on the internet:</h3>

<ol class="numbered-list mt-20">
  <li>Lake Como day trip from Milan with 50 people in a group, and the tour is bilingual ‚Äì English and Spanish at the same time. (These are the cheapest tours, but they can be rushed, with a long 4 to 5 hours on the bus.) üòµ‚Äçüí´</li>
  <li>Lake Como day trip from Milan in a private group, exclusively for you and your friends (prices starting from 1000 euros per tour). üòâ</li>
  <li>Lake Como day trip from Milan in a small group tour with up to 12 people (offers a good quality/price ratio). üòç</li>
</ol>

            <p class="mt-20">
                You have probably already read many websites and articles about the beauty of Lake Como. I bet you know that on Lake Como, you might encounter world-famous actors, singers, and celebrities. In 2022, George Clooney invited Michael Jordan (both were on the lake) for a dinner in his luxurious villa. At the end of June 2022, there was a wedding of a UK billionaire with 250 guests in one lavish villa on Lake Como, with Lady Gaga performing the ceremony. Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler were staying in a luxury hotel while filming the movie ‚ÄòMurder Mystery.‚Äô On Lake Como, we literally have hundreds of places that will ravish you.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-20">Now let‚Äôs be down to earth. The best way to see Lake Como is to stay in a 5-star luxury hotel and rent a private boat, just like all the celebrities do. Lake Como will reveal its incredible beauty to you, and you will fall in love with this place forever. Imagine a small Venetian-style boat picking you up at a private villa or a luxury hotel on the lakeshore. The taxi boat can drop you off at a restaurant with a private dock, offering magnificent views of the lake and mountains. You will be away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds that visit Lake Como on their own.</p>

<p class="mt-20">The above description represents a&nbsp;<strong>luxury experience for the wealthy or famous folks with nearly unlimited budgets</strong>, who can easily spend thousands of euros per day.</p>

<p class="mt-20">On the other hand, you can have a&nbsp;<strong>budget-friendly Lake Como day trip from Milan</strong>, but there is one thing you should take into consideration: the famous and luxurious villas, in your eyes, will be just simple buildings with nice gardens. In other words, you&nbsp;<strong>will miss out on all the history, curiosities, and gossip behind those villas</strong>. And, of course, you‚Äôll encounter a large number of tourists at one of the most popular travel destinations in Europe. This means that crowds will be everywhere ‚Äî unless you read the whole article and plan your trip to avoid touristy places and crammed boats.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          Okay, you want to spend a beautiful day on Lake Como, but you don't want to deal with organizational details and logistics? On the internet, you can easily find many tours. The price range is <strong>80 to 130 euros</strong> for a big group tour. <strong>Small group tours</strong> will be <strong>170 to 250 euros per person</strong>. And finally, the <strong>private group tour is 1000+ euros</strong>. What can you expect if you book one of those?
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>Big Group Tours</strong> usually include two or three of the following places: Como, Bellagio, Varenna, Menaggio, and Lugano (Switzerland).
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          These activities are provided by bus companies, so expect to be <strong>packed on the bus with 50 strangers</strong>. It takes up to 1.5 hours to reach Como city or almost 2 hours to reach Varenna or Menaggio. To fill up the bus seats, most tour operators offer <strong>bilingual tours</strong>. You will hear your guide speaking <strong>Spanish and English</strong> throughout the day. In other words, it is not one guide for English and one for Spanish; the guide is one person who will speak both languages simultaneously. So, how do you know if the tour you are looking for is in two languages? When websites offer a tour in more than one language, it means it is bilingual.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>Second downside of a big group tour:</strong> you'll be on a regular public boat with <strong>300 to 700 tourists</strong>, not a private one!
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          These tours typically involve spending <strong>4 to 5 hours on the bus and 2 to 2.5 hours on the crowded boat</strong> (where you may have to wait a long time to board). The overall duration is around <strong>10 to 11 hours</strong>, with <strong>6 to 7 hours spent on the bus and boat</strong>, and only 4 to 5 hours for lunch and exploring.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          In summary, <strong>when you purchase a big group tour from Milan, you're paying for a round trip by bus, a regular public boat, a guide, and a radio device</strong>. However, keep in mind that the guide is often bilingual, and you'll have limited time at each location.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>The main purpose of tour companies is to help you avoid hustle and bustle. They should keep you away from crowds, not take you into the middle of them.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          If you don't want to <strong>deal with all the organizational details and logistics</strong> and <strong>just want to relax</strong>, or if you want to gain <strong>deeper knowledge of the lake and hear about Hollywood celebrities</strong>, consider taking a tour in a <strong>small group of up to 12 people to Como</strong>. You'll enjoy a boat cruise on the lake and get to see the beautiful villas where world-famous movies were filmed and where celebrities have held their weddings.

        <p class="mt-20">
          Lake Como has served as the filming location for renowned movies such as Ocean's Twelve, James Bond, Star Wars, Murder Mystery, and The House of Gucci. Additionally, the lake boasts a villa with ghost stories and is home to numerous villas owned by millionaires and billionaires like George Clooney and Richard Branson. There is a specific point on the lake where a self-educated Italian inventor built a submarine and reached the lake's deepest point ‚Äì 412 meters ‚Äì in 1948. The incredible history of the region dates back to the Roman Empire, and the abundance of gossip stories will exceed all your expectations.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>By joining our tour, you will have the opportunity to uncover this fascinating history and experience the true essence of Lake Como.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          Going to Lake Como on your own may result in a poor experience. <strong>Without a guide, you'll miss out on historically important signs and stories.</strong> To fully enjoy the beauty of Como Lake, <strong>it's highly recommended to be guided.</strong> We believe the best value-for-money tour is a small group of up to 12 people.

        <h3 class="text-30 md:text-24">Como Lake: What to See?</h3>
        
        <p class="mt-20">
          First, let's understand the geography. Como Lake has a shape like an upside-down 'Y' (‚ÖÑ) and stretches for 48 km (30 miles) from north to south. Along the lake's shores, you'll find two cities and over 40 villages. Now, you might be wondering if it's worth driving the entire length of the lake. Which attractions are a must-see, and what can you skip? <strong>How can you move around Como Lake without stress</strong>? Keep reading to find out.
        </p>

        <div class="mt-20 p-20" style="background-color: #fff3cd; border: 1px solid #ffeeba; border-radius: 8px;">
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #856404;">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è:</strong> <strong>Como Lake is a large area, and it's possible to visit only a few attractions in one day.</strong> Exploring two villages, taking a boat ride, and visiting a garden is the maximum you can comfortably do in a single day. If you want to fully experience the entire lake, I recommend staying in a hotel located on the lake for at least three nights.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>The most popular and fascinating section</strong> of the lake is the branch that stretches from Bellagio to Como. This area is home to <strong>famous villas</strong>, <strong>wedding venues</strong>, and has been <strong>featured in Hollywood and Bollywood movies</strong>. Spanning approximately 25 km (15 miles), this part of the lake offers a chance to create lasting memories. Now, let's explore some brief information about the main cities and attractions along this route, listed in chronological order from north to south.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="text-24 md:text-20">Menaggio</h4>
        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>Menaggio</strong> is a charming village with an elegant waterfront promenade adorned with blooming flower beds in spring. The gentle slopes of Menaggio make it one of the largest villages on Como Lake, with many medieval buildings in the upper part of the city. You'll find a few luxury hotels and plenty of lunch/dinner options to choose from.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-24 md:text-20 mt-30">Varenna</h4>
        
        <!-- Varenna - –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ -->
        <div class="row y-gap-30 pt-20">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="mt-0">
              <strong>Varenna</strong> is like a picture-perfect village, with its narrow cobblestone streets and a pedestrian-only center. The main square is filled with bars and restaurants that overlook the lake. Everything in Varenna is conveniently within walking distance, and you only need 1-2 hours to explore and capture some beautiful photos. Varenna is also home to one of the four villa-museums on Como Lake, Villa Monastero, which you can visit.
            </p>

        <h4 class="text-24 md:text-20 mt-30">Bellagio</h4>
        
        <!-- Bellagio - –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–ª–µ–≤–∞ -->
        <div class="row y-gap-30 pt-20">

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="mt-0">
              <strong>Bellagio</strong>, known as "the pearl of Como Lake," may sound familiar to you. In fact, Steve Wynn was inspired by the original Bellagio when he built the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. This tiny city is incredibly photogenic, with postcard views and Instagram-worthy spots at every turn. One of the largest botanical gardens on Como Lake, Villa Melzi, is located here, and you can actually visit it. If you're looking for a peaceful escape from the crowds, take a walk to Villa Melzi or Pescallo, a less touristy hamlet of Bellagio.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>Bellagio can get extremely crowded</strong>, especially after 11:00 am. Large groups of 30 to 80 people arrive from Milan after 12:00 pm and completely transform this beautiful place into a noisy and unpleasant environment. The good news is that most tourists only stay in Bellagio for 2 to 3 hours and stick to the main streets. <strong>If you want to enjoy Bellagio, it's best to go in the early morning or by private boat. Otherwise don't go to Bellagio at all</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-24 md:text-20 mt-30">Tremezzo</h4>
        
        <!-- Tremezzo - –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ -->
        <div class="row y-gap-30 pt-20">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="mt-0">
              In <strong>Tremezzo</strong>, just across the lake, you'll find Villa Carlotta, the most popular attraction on Como Lake. This impressive villa features a vast 75,000 square meter botanical garden and showcases remarkable artworks by Antonio Canova and Francesco Hayez across three floors. The best time to visit Villa Carlotta is in April and May when you can admire the colorful flower bushes from the opposite shore of the lake.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="mt-20">
          In a significant event that altered history, Tremezzo was the site where a consequential event unfolded at the end of the Second World War. On April 27, 1945, Benito Mussolini was arrested while attempting to escape to Switzerland. The following day, April 28, he was shot dead, along with his mistress Claretta Petacci, in the hamlet of Giulino di Mezzegra in Tremezzo.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-24 md:text-20 mt-30">Lenno</h4>
        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>Lenno</strong> is a quiet, small village with a pedestrian waterfront promenade and a beach where you can swim. It's important to note that all the beaches on Como Lake are made of stones or rocks, so remember to bring suitable footwear for getting into the water.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          The most fascinating feature of Lenno is <strong>Villa Balbianello</strong>, which is widely regarded as the most beautiful villa on Como Lake. Some scenes from movies like James Bond Casino Royale and Star Wars ‚Äì Attack of the Clones were filmed here. The villa is situated in a secluded location at the end of a large promontory, making it a bit challenging to reach. You can either take a 25-30 minute walk or catch a boat taxi from the harbor of Lenno (boat taxis operate without a fixed timetable, departing every 10-20 minutes). If you're unable to visit the villa or simply not interested, you'll still be able to see it from the water, and it will undoubtedly leave you in awe.

        <h4 class="text-24 md:text-20 mt-30">Comacina Island and Sala Comacina</h4>
        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>Comacina Island and Sala Comacina:</strong> On Como Lake, there is a single island known as Comacina Island, which is relatively small, measuring only 600 meters in length and 200 meters in width. The island boasts archaeological sites dating back to the Roman Empire. On the shore facing the island, you can explore the charming village of Sala Comacina. The village showcases stone portals, narrow bridges, balconies adorned with flowers, and colorful stone facades. The mountainside above Sala Comacina is adorned with olive groves. Sala Comacina offers a few attractions, and a couple of hours will be sufficient to see everything.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-24 md:text-20 mt-30">Argegno</h4>
        <p class="mt-20">
          <strong>Argegno:</strong> Upon reaching Argegno, you'll immediately notice numerous bars and restaurants with breathtaking lake views. Like other small villages around Como Lake, the streets of Argegno are paved with cobblestones. In the narrow alleys of the upper part of the village (less crowded), you can find souvenir shops and seek shade on sunny summer days. Argegno is less touristy compared to Bellagio or Varenna, allowing you to enjoy good quality meals at local bars and restaurants throughout the village.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          In 1948, an Italian inventor named Pietro Vessena, who was a self-educated engineer without a scientific degree, achieved a remarkable feat. He built a submarine and successfully dived to the deepest point of the lake, which is 412 meters, in front of Argegno.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-20">
          From Argegno, you can also visit one of the most breathtaking panoramic viewpoints of the lake ‚Äì the village of Pigra. A cable car takes you from the lakeshore to the top at an altitude of 850 meters. The price for a round trip is incredibly affordable at just 5 euros, and the view from the top is truly priceless.
