      <h2>What You‚Äôll Experience</h2>

      <h3>Bellagio</h3>
      <p>
        Step into the picture-perfect world of Bellagio ‚Äî the iconic village often featured in films and travel publications. Stroll through elegant lanes lined with boutique shops and colorful facades that reflect the charm of traditional Italian lakeside life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take in sweeping panoramic views of Lake Como and enjoy a relaxing lunch at one of the inviting lakeside restaurants. The itinerary also includes free time, allowing for independent exploration ‚Äî whether that entails savoring a gelato, shopping for local goods, or simply absorbing the atmosphere at your own pace.
      </p>

      <h3>Bellano Gorge <span style="font-weight: normal;">(Hidden Gem)</span></h3>
      <p>
        This is where you‚Äôll experience the real Lake Como ‚Äî far from the tourist crowds. Discover a dramatic gorge with suspended walkways carved into the cliffs, where waterfalls crash below and the air feels cool and fresh.
      </p>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs a favorite hidden spot among locals, rarely seen by mass-tour groups. After the gorge, enjoy a peaceful stroll through the quiet lakeside town of Bellano, where time seems to slow down and the views are pure magic.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenic Lake Views from the Boat</h3>
      <p>We take the scenic route ‚Äî literally. Cruise across the most beautiful branch of Lake Como on a panoramic public boat, soaking in cinematic views from the water.</p>
      <p>Along the way, you‚Äôll pass charming villages, historic villas, and picture-perfect landscapes ‚Äî with insider stories that bring every scene to life.</p>

      <h3>Lecco or Varenna <span style="font-weight: normal;">(Depending on the Season)</span></h3>
      <p>Until <strong>September 15, 2025</strong>, we visit <strong>Lecco</strong>, a tranquil lakeside town that‚Äôs still wonderfully undiscovered. It's full of authentic Italian charm ‚Äî no crowds, no chaos, just peaceful beauty and real local life.</p>
      <p>Starting <strong>September 16, 2025</strong>, we switch to <strong>Varenna</strong> ‚Äî Lake Como‚Äôs second most famous village. Romantic, colorful, and built for wandering, Varenna is everything you imagine when you dream of Italy. Think cobblestone lanes, stunning lakefront views, and perfect photo ops around every corner.</p>

        ‚ÄúThis tour (Milan -> Varenna -> Bellagio -> Bellano -> Milan) was possibly the best part of my trip to Italy. The 
        guide Oleg was super friendly and welcoming. The highlight was definitely the Bellano Gorge ‚Äì an absolutely beautiful 
        place that I would have not visited on my own.‚Äù

        ‚ÄúPick this tour!!! Oleg was fantastic ‚Äî knowledgeable, kind, and very organized. We had a private tour due to low 
        numbers, which was well worth it. Bellano is a very small, beautiful town with no crowds, and the gorge walk was 
        unique and stunning. Plenty of time to enjoy coffee or wine without feeling rushed. Highly recommended!‚Äù

        The tour itself was outstanding and I highly recommend it to everyone. We went to the major sites, but at a time that other 
        groups were not around! The gorge was wonderful by itself and worth the effort. But add in the other villages and 2 Boat Trip, 
        well I can't say enough.‚Äù

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">What is the difference between your tour and other Lake Como/Bellagio tours? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p> 90% of Lake Como tours from Milan are done with big buses carrying 60 people. Most of these tours are bilingual, meaning the guide speaks in two languages ‚Äî which takes time and breaks the flow.</p>
    <p>Forget ‚Äúpeaceful escape‚Äù on those big-bus budget tours. They‚Äôre exhausting ‚Äî up to 5 hours stuck in traffic on a narrow lakeside road, only to be rushed through packed stops with no personal touch. That‚Äôs not a tour. That‚Äôs a checklist on wheels.</p>
    <p>Most of these tours follow the exact same route and arrive in Bellagio at the same time, right when it's at its most crowded and chaotic.</p>
    <p>On top of that, starting in 2025, new regulations in Bellagio limit each guide to 25 people. So in those large groups, there is no real ‚Äútour‚Äù in Bellagio. The guide simply says: ‚ÄúMeet back here in 1.5 hours‚Äù ‚Äî and you‚Äôre left to explore on your own.</p>
    <p>Our tour is different. Small group, no rush, no loudspeaker, no tour bus stress. You actually get to enjoy the places we visit ‚Äî with a real guide by your side.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Is this suitable for kids? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Recommended for ages 5 and up. Younger children may find it hard to keep up.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Is it wheelchair or stroller accessible? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>There are some staircases, so we do not recommend this tour for wheelchairs or strollers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Can I cancel for free? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, you can cancel free of charge up to 24 hours before the tour.</p>
<p><strong>And here‚Äôs something no one else in the industry offers:</strong> if you don‚Äôt show up, we still refund 25% ‚Äî no questions asked.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">What if it rains? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>A little rain can even be nice ‚Äî on Lake Como there will be fewer people, so you will almost have it to yourself.</p>
        <p>If the weather is very bad, we will cancel and offer you other dates or a full refund.</p>
        <p>Please bring comfortable shoes and suitable clothing.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Do I pay less when booking directly on your website? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>YES! We sell our tours on big marketplaces. But here, you book directly with us, skipping the middleman.</p>
        <p>This means better prices for you and more support for our small local business.</p>
        <p>We can offer you better conditions and a better cancellation policy for direct bookings.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Can I reserve now and pay later? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes! You can reserve your spot now and pay nothing until 48 hours before the tour starts.</p>
        <p>Just select ‚Äúzero deposit‚Äù when you book.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Do you offer special rates for travel agents or agencies? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>

    <h2>Why are our tours the best rated from Milan on TripAdvisor, Viator & GetYourGuide?</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Because all the tours were created by an expert tour guide who was fed up with mass tourism <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Oleg. For years, I led large 50-person bilingual tours from Milan to Lake Como ‚Äî long hours on a bus, rushing through crowded spots. It was exhausting and felt fake.</p>
        <p>In 2023, I said ‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù and started Abroads Tours with Stefano to change everything.</p>
        <p>We run small, personal tours. Yes, you‚Äôll see the famous places ‚Äî but we also take you off the beaten path to peaceful villages and hidden gems that big groups miss.</p>
        <p>Our guests give us 5 stars again and again because we offer what mass tourism can‚Äôt: real stories, local knowledge, and genuine connections.</p>
