    <h2>What You’ll Experience</h2>

  <h3>Como</h3>
<p>
  Hop on a comfortable Swiss express train in Milan and reach the charming town of Como in just 40 minutes. Start your day with a relaxed walk through Como’s picturesque old town, where cobbled streets open into elegant piazzas, a stunning historic cathedral, and a peaceful lakeside promenade.
</p>
<p>
  Feel the gentle breeze off the lake as you soak in breathtaking views, and let your guide share captivating stories that bring the city's rich history and timeless beauty to life — making every moment feel like a dream.
</p>


  <h3>Lake Como Boat Cruise</h3>
<p>
  Board a scenic boat and cruise the serene waters of Lake Como. Take in panoramic views of beautiful villas, lush gardens, and majestic mountains that surround the lake. Glide past charming lakeside villages with colorful houses and quaint streets, each offering its own unique charm.
</p>
<p>
  Enjoy the view of celebrity villas — including the former Versace villa, the villa featured in the Ocean’s Twelve filming, and the villa where John Legend got married.
</p>


<h3>Lugano, Switzerland</h3>
<p>
  Cross the border into Switzerland to visit Lugano, a beautiful city framed by majestic mountains. Wander along the peaceful lakeside promenade, where palm trees sway and the water sparkles in the sunlight. Explore charming streets filled with stylish shops and cozy cafés.
</p>
<p>
  Don’t miss the chance to taste some of the world’s finest Swiss chocolate — a true delight in this unique Swiss-Italian city with Italian charm.
<h3>Lake Lugano</h3>

  Lake Lugano is a beautiful, calm lake surrounded by green mountains and small towns. The clear blue water is perfect for relaxing and enjoying the peaceful view.
</p>
<p>
  Along the shore, you’ll see pretty villas, gardens, and small cafés where you can enjoy a coffee while watching boats pass by. Walking by the lake or sitting in the sun, Lake Lugano feels like a quiet, lovely place to rest and enjoy nature in a mix of Swiss and Italian style.
</p>


    <h3>Free Time & Local Food Suggestions</h3>
    <p>You’ll have free time in both Como and Lugano to explore at your own pace, grab a coffee, or enjoy a meal. Your guide will happily recommend authentic local spots for an unforgettable culinary experience.</p>
    
   <h3>Stop by a charming, authentic village — a true hidden gem</h3>
<p>Only on our tours will you visit a real, non-touristy Lake Como village — the kind most travelers never get to see. It’s a quiet, beautiful spot where you can truly experience the authentic life around the lake.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">Do we visit Bellagio on this tour? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
<div class="faq-answer">
  <p>No, this tour doesn’t go to Bellagio — and there’s a reason for that.</p>
  <p>Bellagio is beautiful, no doubt. But most tours take the worst possible route: 50 people crammed in a bus, stuck for 5+ hours in traffic on narrow lake roads, only to be rushed through the most crowded spots with barely enough time for a quick photo and a snack.</p>
  <p>This tour is different. It skips the chaos and goes where the big tours don’t — to peaceful, authentic villages where Lake Como still feels like Lake Como.</p>
  <p>If Bellagio is on the wish list, no problem. We offer a separate small-group tour to Bellagio and Bellano — done right. No big buses. No chaos. Just an unforgettable day.</p>
  <p><strong>Our Bellagio tour is the best way to visit Bellagio.</strong></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">What is the difference between this tour and others? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Most tours don’t deliver an experience — they deliver a checklist.</p>
<p>Five hours stuck on a crowded bus, crawling through narrow, traffic-choked roads along Lake Como. Stops last barely 1 hour at crowded tourist traps, rushed and superficial.</p>
<p>Same tired route, same overcrowded spots, same stress. Beautiful places reduced to quick photo stops, with no time to breathe or truly enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>These tours burn time — not memories.</strong></p>
<p>Our tours skip the chaos and traffic jams. They focus on real moments, quiet spots, and enough time to savor the beauty properly.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">Is this suitable for kids? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Recommended for ages 5 and up. Younger children may find it difficult to keep up with the pace of the tour.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">Is it wheelchair or stroller accessible? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>There are several staircases and narrow cobblestone streets, so we do not recommend this tour for wheelchairs or strollers.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">Can I cancel for free? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Yes. You can cancel free of charge up to 24 hours before the tour starts.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">What if it rains? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>A little rain can be magical — bringing fewer people and a more peaceful, authentic experience.</p>
      <p>If the weather is really bad, we’ll cancel and offer you other dates or a full refund.</p>
      <p>Just bring comfortable shoes and weather-appropriate clothing.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">Do I pay less when booking directly on your website? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>YES! We sell our tours on big marketplaces, but when you book here, you skip the middleman.</p>
      <p>That means a better price for you — and more support for our small, local business.</p>
      <p>You also get more flexible cancellation terms when booking directly with us.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">Can I reserve now and pay later? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Yes! You can reserve your spot now and pay nothing until 48 hours before the tour starts.</p>
      <p>Just choose the “zero deposit” option when you book.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">Do you offer special rates for travel agents or agencies? <span class="arrow">+</span></button>

    <h2>Why are our tours the best rated from Milan on TripAdvisor, Viator & GetYourGuide?</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">Because all the tours were created by an expert tour guide who was fed up with mass tourism <span class="arrow">+</span></button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Hi, I’m Oleg. For years, I led large 50-person bilingual tours from Milan to Lake Como — long hours on a bus, rushing through crowded spots. It was exhausting and felt fake.</p>
        <p>In 2023, I said “Enough!” and started Abroads Tours with Stefano to change everything.</p>
        <p>We run small, personal tours. Yes, you’ll see the famous places — but we also take you off the beaten path to peaceful villages and hidden gems that big groups miss.</p>
        <p>Our guests give us 5 stars again and again because we offer what mass tourism can’t: real stories, local knowledge, and genuine connections.</p>

But most tours take the worst possible route: 50 people crammed in a bus, stuck for 5+ hours in traffic on narrow lake roads, only to be rushed through the most crowded spots with barely enough time for a quick photo and a snack. This tour is different. It skips the chaos and goes where the big tours don’t — to peaceful, authentic villages where Lake Como still feels like Lake Como. If Bellagio is on the wish list, no problem. We offer a separate small-group tour to Bellagio and Bellano — done right. No big buses. No chaos. Just an unforgettable day. Our Bellagio tour is the best way to visit Bellagio."

            "text": "Most tours don’t deliver an experience — they deliver a checklist. Five hours stuck on a crowded bus, crawling through narrow, traffic-choked roads along Lake Como. Stops last barely 1 hour at crowded tourist traps, rushed and superficial. Same tired route, same overcrowded spots, same stress. Beautiful places reduced to quick photo stops, with no time to breathe or truly enjoy. These tours burn time — not memories. Our tours skip the chaos and traffic jams. They focus on real moments, quiet spots, and enough time to savor the beauty properly."
