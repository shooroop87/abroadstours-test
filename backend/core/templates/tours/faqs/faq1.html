        <div class="pt-20">
          <p class="mt-20">90% of Lake Como tours from Milan are done with big buses carrying 60 people. Most of these tours are bilingual, meaning the guide speaks in two languages — which takes time and breaks the flow.</p>
          <p class="mt-20">Forget "peaceful escape" on those big-bus budget tours. They're exhausting — up to 5 hours stuck in traffic on a narrow lakeside road, only to be rushed through packed stops with no personal touch. That's not a tour. That's a checklist on wheels.</p>
          <p class="mt-20">Most of these tours follow the exact same route and arrive in Bellagio at the same time, right when it's at its most crowded and chaotic.</p>
          <p class="mt-20">On top of that, starting in 2025, new regulations in Bellagio limit each guide to 25 people. So in those large groups, there is no real "tour" in Bellagio. The guide simply says: "Meet back here in 1.5 hours" — and you're left to explore on your own.</p>
          <p class="mt-20">Our tour is different. Small group, no rush, no loudspeaker, no tour bus stress. You actually get to enjoy the places we visit — with a real guide by your side.</p>

<h2 class="text-30">Why are our tours the best rated from Milan on TripAdvisor, Viator & GetYourGuide?</h2>
<p class="mt-20"><b>Because all the tours were created by an expert tour guide who was fed up with mass tourism.</b></p>
<p class="mt-20">Hi, I'm Oleg. For years, I led large 50-person bilingual tours from Milan to Lake Como — long hours on a bus, rushing through crowded spots. It was exhausting and felt fake.</p>
<p class="mt-20">We run small, personal tours. Yes, you'll see the famous places — but we also take you off the beaten path to peaceful villages and hidden gems that big groups miss.</p>
<p class="mt-20">Our guests give us 5 stars again and again because we offer what mass tourism can't: real stories, local knowledge, and genuine connections.</p>
