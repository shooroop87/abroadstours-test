  <div class="itinerary-block fade-up">
  <h3>🍫 Alba – Truffle Capital of the World</h3>
  <p>
    Discover Alba — the gastronomic heart of Piedmont, internationally renowned for its white truffles, artisanal chocolate, and premium hazelnuts.
  </p>
  <p class="more-text hidden">
    This isn’t a place for tour buses or souvenir stalls. Alba is reserved, refined, and blissfully untouched by mass tourism — a destination that rewards those with a taste for authenticity and elegance.
    <br><br>
    Meander through quiet, cobblestone streets framed by medieval towers and noble townhouses. Browse curated food boutiques, truffle specialists, and family-run pasticcerias that have perfected their craft for generations.
    <br><br>
    Around each corner, you'll find stories carved in stone — from Roman foundations to Renaissance façades. It’s a setting of understated charm and historical richness, ideal for travelers who prefer culture over crowds and quality over quantity.
    <br><br>
    Sip a perfect espresso in a sunlit square and experience what few others do: a peaceful, elegant Italy that still belongs to the locals.

  <h3>🍷 A Family-Run Winery with 6 Top Wines</h3>
  <p>
    Savor 6 exceptional wines — including the iconic Barolo — at a boutique, family-owned estate surrounded by the quiet beauty of the Langhe hills.
  </p>
  <p class="more-text hidden">
    This is not a commercial stop. It’s an intimate, curated tasting experience hosted by the winemakers themselves — a family with deep roots in Barolo's terroir and traditions.
    <br><br>
    You’ll be welcomed as a guest, not a tourist. Each glass reveals the elegance, complexity, and passion that define Piedmont’s finest reds — guided by people who live and breathe this land.
    <br><br>
    Sit back, enjoy refined local pairings, and take in views that stretch across UNESCO-protected vineyards. No crowds, no shortcuts — just timeless Italian hospitality, delivered with precision and pride.

  <h3>🏰 A UNESCO Castle & a Glass of Wine with a View</h3>
  <p>
    Step into Grinzane Cavour — a perfectly preserved 11th-century castle rising above the rolling vineyards of the Langhe.
  </p>
  <p class="more-text hidden">
    This UNESCO World Heritage Site isn’t just a castle — it’s a celebration of Piedmont’s wine legacy. Inside, you’ll find vaulted stone halls, noble history, and the region’s oldest enoteca: a curated collection of Barolo and Barbaresco beneath centuries-old beams.
    <br><br>
    Then comes the moment to pause. A hand-picked glass of wine, a quiet terrace, and panoramic views stretching across some of Italy’s most prestigious vineyards.
    <br><br>
    It’s an experience designed for those who appreciate heritage and elegance.

  <h3>🍽️ Taste Real Italian Food – The Way It’s Meant to Be</h3>
  <p>
    In Alba, cuisine isn’t a meal — it’s heritage. Every dish tells a story, and every ingredient is a celebration of local excellence.
  </p>
  <p class="more-text hidden">
    This is the birthplace of the Slow Food movement, where white truffles are revered like diamonds and hazelnuts become culinary treasures. Forget the tourist menus and factory-made flavors — here, you'll enjoy seasonal, artisanal dishes crafted by chefs who treat cooking as an art.
    <br><br>
    Surrounded by vineyards and Michelin-starred kitchens, Alba offers a dining experience that’s refined, deeply rooted, and utterly unforgettable. It’s not just food — it’s a way of life.

      <span class="short-text">My husband and I went for this day trip in a super small group with one other family. The whole day was calm, well organised and away from the chaos of tourists.</span>
      <span class="full-text">  We got to experience the incredible beauty of the piedmont region of Italy with a stop off at probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip. The wine tasting was hosted by a lovely family run business and we had some great conversation at the end. Stefano was friendly and knowledgeable and he made sure that we were comfortable on the drive in 35 degree heat! If you visit northern Italy, I really recommend you try this day trip. You won’t regret it! It was the highlight of our trip for sure!</span>

      <span class="short-text">My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Italy and chose this tour—and we’re so glad we did. It was the perfect way to explore Piedmont’s wine country without the hassle of planning or worrying about driving.</span>
      <span class="full-text"><br><br>
         Our guide was super friendly, full of energy, and just a lot of fun to spend the day with. He had a ton of knowledge and local connections, which made each stop feel extra special. We got to explore the charming town of Alba, visit the Grinzane Cavour Castle (which was incredible), and of course, drink a lot of amazing wine—including Barolo, which was a huge highlight.<br><br>
         We also learned a ton about the history and culture of the area, which made the whole experience feel deeper and more meaningful. It wasn’t just about wine—it was about the people, the land, and the stories behind it all.<br><br>
         Super easy, super fun, and honestly one of the best decisions we made on our honeymoon. We’re very glad we chose this group and not a giant tourism company. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an unforgettable day in wine country.</span>

        <span class="short-text">This tour was amazing, I would give it 10 stars if I could! Booking with the tour company was easy and efficient and the meeting place was very convenient.</span>
        <span class="full-text"> Stefano, our guide, was exceptional - his passion for this area was infectious! He shared lively commentary on the history and culture of the region, made sure our group was comfortable and cared for, and gave us great suggestions for restaurants for lunch. The tour was well paced and relaxed, with ample time to stroll and explore, while seeing the important sites. The Piedmont countryside is beautiful and the town of Alba is a gem, charming and uncrowded. The stop at the family run winery and vineyard was fantastic, with substantial quality time spent on the tastings and wine making process. The wines were the stars of course, of superb quality. The experience of smaller group tour, stunning scenery, great wine, and a relaxed pace made for an unforgettable day. If you want to experience an authentic wine tour, this is the one!</span>

        <span class="short-text">The Barolo wine tour was one of my favorite experiences in the 5 weeks I’ve spent in Italy.</span>
        <span class="full-text"> The Langhe is a magical place featuring beautiful landscapes, great wines, white truffles, hazelnuts, and delicious local food. The tour was well-organized, entertaining, and very informative. The tour guide (Stefano) was the highlight of the trip. Stefano taught us the history of the region, entertained us and made us laugh all day. This is a small local tour company so the experience is very authentic and personal. I would highly recommend Abroads Tours…great value. Don’t miss an opportunity to let Abroads Tours enhance your Italy travel experience.</span>

        <span class="short-text">I had a wonderful time on this day trip, the guide was Naji and she was incredibly kind, gave us interesting information, and great recommendations!</span>
        <span class="full-text"> Even though it rained the majority of the day it didn’t spoil a thing. The winery we visited was excellent and the woman who ran the tasting was genuine and very knowledgeable. 10/10 would recommend this to anyone. The city of Alba was beautiful as well as the castle visit. I am very happy I signed up for this activity.</span>

  <h2>Why Are Our Tours the Best Rated from Milan on TripAdvisor, Viator & GetYourGuide?</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question">
      Because all tours were created by expert guides fed up with mass tourism <span class="arrow">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>We are Oleg and Stefano. For years, we led large 50-person bilingual tours from Milan to Lake Como—long hours on a crowded bus, rushing through packed tourist spots. It was exhausting, impersonal, and simply not the experience we wanted to offer.</p>
      <p>In 2023, we said “Enough!” and launched Abroads Tours to change the way people explore Italy.</p>
      <p>Our tours are small and personal. Sure, you’ll see the famous sights—but we also take you off the beaten path to peaceful villages and hidden gems that mass tourism misses.</p>
      <p>Our guests keep giving us 5-star reviews because we deliver what big groups can’t: authentic stories, deep local knowledge, and genuine connections with the people and places we visit.</p>
