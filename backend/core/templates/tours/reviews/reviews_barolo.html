    </div>

    <p class="mt-10">"This tour was a highlight of our trip to Milan! The wines we tasted were absolutely fantastic, and traveling in a small group made the whole experience feel more intimate and personal. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable, which made the drive from Milan feel much shorter. Highly recommended!"</p>

    </div>

    <p class="mt-10">"It was wonderful day we spent together with our tour guide Monica traveling through wine making areas off beaten path. She filled us with such an interesting cultural, historical and gastronomic information and experience! We visited several beautiful places like Alba city, Barolo area and Medieval Castle. High class wine testing impressed us with professionalism and passion of wine making. Comfortable travel in small group in the comfortable minibus and friendly atmosphere made this day unforgettable. Highly recommended trip experience. Thank you Monica!"</p>

    </div>

    <p class="mt-10">"My husband and I went for this day trip in a super small group with one other family. The whole day was calm, well organised and away from the chaos of tourists. We got to experience the incredible beauty of the piedmont region of Italy with a stop off at probably the best restaurant we went to on our trip. The wine tasting was hosted by a lovely family run business and we had some great conversation at the end. Stefano was friendly and knowledgeable and he made sure that we were comfortable on the drive in 35 degree heat! If you visit northern Italy, I really recommend you try this day trip. You won't regret it! It was the highlight of our trip for sure!"</p>

    </div>

    <p class="mt-10">"My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Italy and chose this tour—and we're so glad we did. It was the perfect way to explore Piedmont's wine country without the hassle of planning or worrying about driving. Our guide was super friendly, full of energy, and just a lot of fun to spend the day with. He had a ton of knowledge and local connections, which made each stop feel extra special. We got to explore the charming town of Alba, visit the Grinzane Cavour Castle (which was incredible), and of course, drink a lot of amazing wine—including Barolo, which was a huge highlight. Super easy, super fun, and honestly one of the best decisions we made on our honeymoon. We're very glad we chose this group and not a giant tourism company. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an unforgettable day in wine country."</p>

      <p class="mt-10">"Giulia was one of the best tour guides I have ever had. Knowledgeable, passionate, excited- she really brought the tour to life and brought her whole self to the tour. Plus her photography skills were top notch! The tour was a great balance of exploration and wine. The small-group setting really enhanced the experience, and our driver Fabio was fabulous. Cannot recommend this enough!"</p>

      <p class="mt-10">"I truly had a wonderful day among the vineyards and hazelnut groves of the Langhe region, an experience I recommend everyone to try, even for those not fond of wine. The organisation was impeccable, with wine tasting, a view of the city of Alba, and Cavour Castle, plus a sweet surprise in the midst of it all. Guide was truly informative and took care of the group in an exemplary manner. More than deserving of five stars!"</p>

      </div>

      <p class="mt-10">"This tour was amazing, I would give it 10 stars if I could! Booking with the tour company was easy and efficient and the meeting place was very convenient. Stefano, our guide, was exceptional - his passion for this area was infectious! He shared lively commentary on the history and culture of the region, made sure our group was comfortable and cared for, and gave us great suggestions for restaurants for lunch. The tour was well paced and relaxed, with ample time to stroll and explore, while seeing the important sites. The Piedmont countryside is beautiful and the town of Alba is a gem, charming and uncrowded. The stop at the family run winery and vineyard was fantastic, with substantial quality time spent on the tastings and wine making process. The wines were the stars of course, of superb quality. The experience of smaller group tour, stunning scenery, great wine, and a relaxed pace made for an unforgettable day. If you want to experience an authentic wine tour, this is the one!"</p>

      <p class="mt-10">"The Barolo wine tour was one of my favorite experiences in the 5 weeks I've spent in Italy. The Langhe is a magical place featuring beautiful landscapes, great wines, white truffles, hazelnuts, and delicious local food. The tour was well-organized, entertaining, and very informative. The tour guide (Stefano) was the highlight of the trip. Stefano taught us the history of the region, entertained us and made us laugh all day. This is a small local tour company so the experience is very authentic and personal. I would highly recommend Abroads Tours…great value. Don't miss an opportunity to let Abroads Tours enhance your Italy travel experience."</p>
